AFFECT ON THE WORLD.

DATASET: COVID WEBSITE AND 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

DEXCRIPTION: THE DATASET WAS IN FORM OF A CSV FILE CONTAINING ALL THE 
INFORMATIONS ABOUT COVID VACCINATION.

WHAT I HAD DONE: 
FIRSTLY, IMPORTED THE CSV FILE AND FILTERED IT USING EXCEL SHEET. THEN 
I IMPORTED THE CSV FILE TO JUPYTER NOTEBOOK. WHERE I VISUALIZED THE FACTS. 

I DEVELOPED A NOTEBOOK WHERE WE CAN MODIFY AND CHANGE THE FIELDS TO SEE 
THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTTRY'S INFORMATION. ALSO ADDED A BAR GRAPH AND 
LINE GRAPH  SHOWING ALL COUNTRY'S GDP AFFECTION DUE TO THE 
VIRUS. 

MODELS USED: 
1. BAR GRAPHS
2. LINE GRAPHS


SOFTWARE USED:
1. JUPYTER NOTEBOOK 

CONCLUSION: I WAS SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO DEVELOP A TABLEAU DASHBOARD FOR 
COVID - 19 VACCINE TRACKER.
